I am a third year Mathematic PhD student at the University of St Andrews, UK. My research area is ergodic theory and dynamical systems, in particular, thermodynamic formalism of countable state symbolic system and interval maps. I am primarily supervised by [Prof Mike Todd](https://mtoddm.github.io/). You can find my CV [here](../assets/CV.pdf)
